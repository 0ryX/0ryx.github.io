# Hello world 👋

I am oryx, (AKA deepnet AKA cryptr) an online researcher, writer, low-level developer, archivist and anarchist 🏴
This is my blog [ 0xblockz - a revolt against data collection and the corporate web ]

Our online user-space has been reduced to a handful of companies that have a monopoly over information. There is movement that is 
shaping an online revolution like the indieweb, fediverse, static blogs, rss and the classic webring. In a age of corporate surveillance, there are more data points collected on the average user then ever before, serving as the primary commodity for big tech and AI. The relentless pursuit of information casts a shadow of our digital landscape, bluring the lines between consumer and product; shrinking the size of our online landscape to just a handful of websites owned by the same companies.
