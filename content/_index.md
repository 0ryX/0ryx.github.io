# Hello world 👋

I am oryx; an online researcher, writer, developer, archivist and anarchist 🏴
This is my blog 0xblockz - a revolt against data collection and the corporate web.

Our lives online have been reduced down to a handful of corporate website's that have a monopoly over what we see. There is movement that is shaping an online revolution like the [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), fediverse, static blogs, rss and the classic webring. In a age of corporate surveillance, there are more data points collected on the average user then ever before, serving as the primary commodity for big tech. The relentless pursuit of information casts a shadow of our digital landscape, bluring the lines between consumer and product; shrinking the size of our online landscape to just a handful of websites owned by the same companies.
