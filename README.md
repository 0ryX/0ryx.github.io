# 0xblockz

This is the repo to my static blog site, 0xblockz. My name is oryx <0ryX>

I originally made my blog using Emacs alone. That was a fun project and the way Emacs handles git was pretty awesome. 
Now I no longer use Emacs and switched to using NeoVim alone. Emacs was really fun and came with all the bells and whistle's 
but I wanted more control over what was installed on my system. Meaning less bloat and more control. 

So going from never building anything front end to learning how to create Emacs org files and convert them to html was a learning 
experience but switching to NeoVim I had a choice; I could use golang based hugo for my static blog site (I'm not a fan or familiar with go) or I could use zola which is built on Rust. I went with the Rust based Zola ;)

The theme I used is called tranquil and while it does have some javascript it's cut down and made to be less tracker like is what the author said in his theme description so that's what I went with. Because here in 0xblockz we're anti-google and anti-tracker. If I could I wouldn't even be using Github Because it's owned by MicroSoft but we don't live in a perfect world. But you can find my main git repo's over on codeberg which is mainly where I live these day. If you've read all of this I am proud of you, this is not a blog post oryx this is just a description of your blogs repo - jeez lol
